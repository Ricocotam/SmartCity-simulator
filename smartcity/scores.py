""" This module is used to compute different scores once one step of the
simulation is done.

The city is evaluated wrt the following criteria :
* Pollution, How much the energies have poluted for this tick globally (ie.
  the mean of the pollution produced).
* Spendings, Sum of energy cost.
* Citizens' satisfaction (or happiness), Sum of satisfactions of all citizen
  weighted by the importance each citizen give to each criteria (eather,
  lighting).
