# SmartCity-simulator
Smart City Simulator designed for hackathons !

## Package installation
`pip3 install --user smartcity`
On Google Colab
`!pip3 install smartcity`

Python > 3.6

## Env Instantiation
In the package, 3 envs are available :

- SmartCity-v0 : small env
- SmartCity-v1 : medium env
- SmartCity-v2 : big env

```python
import smartcity
import gym

env = gym.make("SmartCity-v0")

obs, info = env.reset()
```

## Actions
To send action, you have to send a dictionnary instead of the usual vectors. There's 3 keys to send : energies, heaters and lights. Energies defines how much of each type of energy you buy. Lights define whether each light is on or off (a threshold at 0.5 is set). Heaters define the temperature of each heater. To have the size and the type of each parameter, they are available in the `obs` variable. `obs` is a dictionnary you can use to predict your actions. Keys `lights`, `heaters` and `energies_amount` have the exact format requested for actions, you can just copy them.

### Energies
Energies are ordered the same way for all the arrays

## Observations and informations
There's 5 keys in the obs dictionnary :

- `lights` : numpy array of size #light. Each light is either 0 (off) or 1 (on)
- `heaters` : numpy array of size #heater. Each heater is defined by its temperature
- `energies_cost` : cost of each quantity. This cost is defined for each point of each energy
- `energies_amount` : available amount for energy
- `needed_energy` : the total amount of energy needed. If you don't send enough energy, an exception is raised. During Hackathon submission, it will be an elimination criteria. If you buy more energy that needed, it is stored indefinitely so you can use it.

There's 2 keys in `info` dictionnary :

- `light_interraction` : a matrix of shape (#people, #lights). If there's a 1 at `[i, j]`, the citizen `i` is connected to light `light`
- `heaters_interraction` : same as lights but for heaters
- `energy_pollution` : pollution factor for each type of enegy (carbon, nuclear, renewable)

## Example

```python
import smartcity
import gym
import random

env = gym.make("SmartCity-v0")

obs, info = env.reset()

energies = [0.8*obs["needed_energy"], 0.15*obs["needed_energy"], 0.1*obs["needed_energy"]]

lights = np.array([random.random() for _ in range(obs["lights"].shape[0])])
heaters = obs["heaters"] + 2

actions = {"energies": energies, "heaters": heaters, "lights": lights}

obs, score, done, info = env.step(actions)
```

## Evaluation
We'll give you a seed and a json file dubbed `setting.json` and a seed.

```py
import smartcity
import gym

seed = # given seed
env = gym.make("SmartCity-v0")
env.change_settings("path/to/setting.json")
env.seed(seed)

obs, info = env.reset()
# Learning
# your code here

# Evaluation
env.seed(seed)
obs, info = env.reset()

with open("groupe_name.sub", "w") as f:
    for i in range(100):
        actions = # prediction de votre modèle
        obs, score, done, info = env.step(actions)
        f.write(f"{actions}\n")

```
Pour ceux qui sont dans colab, copiez collez le contenu du fichier json dans une variable dans une cellule puis sauvegarder là comme suit :

```py
import json
content = # copy paste subission.json
with open("submission.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(content, f)

import smartcity
import gym

seed = # given seed
env = gym.make("SmartCity-v0")
env.change_settings("submission.json")
env.seed(seed)
```

SEED = 1337
